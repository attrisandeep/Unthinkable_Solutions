# ✅ FINAL STATUS - Everything Working!

## 🎉 System is NOW Running Successfully!

### Backend Server
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: ✅ All API keys valid
- **CORS**: ✅ Port 8080 enabled

### Frontend Server
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Status**: Ready to use

## ✅ Problem Solved!

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch" Error
**Cause**: Frontend was on port 8080, but backend CORS only allowed ports 3000 and 5173

**Fix**: Added port 8080 to CORS allowed origins in `main.py`:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://localhost:8080",  # ← Added this
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080"   # ← And this
],
```

### Issue 2: Backend kept shutting down
**Cause**: Something triggering shutdown when running `python main.py` with reload mode

**Fix**: Use batch files that run uvicorn directly:
- `start-backend.bat` - Starts backend in CMD window
- `start-frontend.bat` - Starts frontend in CMD window

##  What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Frontend code updated to call real API (not mock data)
2. ✅ File upload now sends files to backend
3. ✅ API keys configured (Groq, Pinecone, Jina)
4. ✅ CORS configured for port 8080
5. ✅ Batch files created for reliable startup

---

## 📊 System Architecture

When you upload a file:
```
Browser → Frontend (8080) → Backend (8000) → Jina AI (embeddings) → Pinecone (storage)
```

When you ask a question:
```
Question → Jina AI (embedding) → Pinecone (retrieve docs) → Groq LLM (generate answer) → Browser (streaming)
```
