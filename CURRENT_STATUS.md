# ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS - What You Need to Know

## Good News ‚úÖ
- **Frontend is FIXED** - No longer using mock data
- **Backend is RUNNING** - Server is healthy on port 8000
- **Frontend is RUNNING** - Available at http://localhost:8080

## The Real Problem ‚ùå

**Your API keys are still placeholders!**

The `.env` file currently has:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here        ‚ùå Not a real key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here ‚ùå Not a real key
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key_here        ‚ùå Not a real key
```

This means:
- ‚ùå File uploads won't work (can't create embeddings)
- ‚ùå Queries won't work (can't generate answers)
- ‚ùå You'll get errors when trying to use the system

## What Happens When You Try to Use It Now?

### When you upload a file:
```
Error: Failed to create embeddings
Error: Pinecone authentication failed
```

### When you ask a question:
```
Error: Groq API authentication failed
Error: Cannot generate answer
```

## Simple Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Free API Keys

#### Groq (FREE - for LLM)
1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up with email
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the key (looks like: `gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

#### Pinecone (FREE tier available)
1. Visit: https://www.pinecone.io/
2. Sign up with email
3. Create a "Starter" (free) account
4. Click "Create Index":
   - **Name**: `knowledge-explorer`
   - **Dimensions**: `768` ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT!
   - **Metric**: `cosine`
   - Click "Create"
5. Go to "API Keys" tab
6. Copy your API key

#### Jina AI (Optional - skip for now)
- You can leave this as placeholder
- System will use local embeddings (slower but works)

### Step 2: Edit `.env` File

Open: `c:\Users\User\Unthinkable 2.0\knowledge-spark-38-main\.env`

Replace these lines:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

With your real keys:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_groq_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_actual_pinecone_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend

```powershell
# Find the terminal running "python main.py"
# Press Ctrl+C to stop it
# Then run:
cd "c:\Users\User\Unthinkable 2.0\knowledge-spark-38-main"
python main.py
```

Look for this line:
```
üîë API Keys validation: {'groq': True, 'pinecone': True, 'jina': False}
```

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Go to: http://localhost:8080
2. Click "Attach Documents"
3. Upload a TXT or PDF file
4. Wait for "Uploaded" with green checkmark
5. Ask: "What is this document about?"
6. Get a REAL answer! üéâ

## Why the Setup Wizard Failed

The PowerShell script I created has encoding issues with emojis. But you don't need it - just manually edit the `.env` file as shown above.

## Manual `.env` Configuration Template

Here's exactly what your `.env` should look like:

```env
# KnowledgeExplorer Backend Configuration

# Groq API Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_PUT_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
GROQ_MODEL=mixtral-8x7b-32768
GROQ_TEMPERATURE=0.7
GROQ_MAX_TOKENS=2048

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=PUT_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
PINECONE_ENV=us-east-1-aws
PINECONE_INDEX=knowledge-explorer

# Jina AI Configuration (optional - leave as is to use local embeddings)
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key_here

# Document Processing Configuration
CHUNK_SIZE=512
CHUNK_OVERLAP=64

# Server Configuration
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Upload Configuration
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10485760
```

## Verification

After updating `.env` and restarting backend, test:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

You should see your actual API key prefixes (first few characters).

## Bottom Line

1. ‚úÖ Code is fixed
2. ‚úÖ Servers are running
3. ‚ùå **You need to add real API keys to `.env`**
4. ‚ùå **You need to create a Pinecone index**

**Once you do steps 3 and 4, everything will work!** üöÄ

## Need Help?

- Can't get API keys? Let me know which service
- Not sure how to edit `.env`? I can help
- Getting errors? Share the error message

The system is ready to work - it just needs your API keys!
