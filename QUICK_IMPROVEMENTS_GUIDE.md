# Quick Guide: Using the Improved RAG System

## ðŸŽ¯ What Changed?

Your system now gives **precise, accurate answers** instead of vague ones!

## ðŸš€ How to Use for Best Results

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clear old documents
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/documents/clear-all

# 2. Upload your NEW document
# Use the UI or drag & drop at http://localhost:8080

# 3. Ask questions!
```

### Option 2: Remove Specific Old Document
```bash
# If you know the filename causing issues:
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/documents/filename/old_report.pdf
```

## ðŸ“Š Check What's in Your System
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/documents/stats
```

## âœ… Testing It

1. **Clear all documents** (fresh start)
2. **Upload ONE document**
3. **Ask a question about that document**
4. **Verify**: Answer should ONLY reference that document
