# RAG System Improvements Applied

## üéØ Problems Fixed

### 1. **Vague Answers & Information Mixing**
**Problem**: System was returning vague answers and mixing information from different documents.

**Root Causes**:
- Small chunk size (512 chars) led to fragmented context
- No relevance threshold - low-quality matches were included
- Weak prompt allowed the LLM to use external knowledge
- Old documents weren't being cleared when uploading new ones

**Solutions Applied**:
‚úÖ **Increased chunk size**: 512 ‚Üí 1000 characters (better context)
‚úÖ **Increased overlap**: 64 ‚Üí 200 characters (better continuity)
‚úÖ **Added relevance threshold**: 0.7 minimum score (only high-quality matches)
‚úÖ **Stricter prompt**: Prevents hallucination, enforces context-only answers
‚úÖ **Document management**: New endpoints to clear old documents

---

## üîß Configuration Changes

### Updated Settings (`.env`)
```properties
CHUNK_SIZE=1000          # Was: 512
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200        # Was: 64
MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.7  # New: Filters low-quality matches
```

### Improved Prompt System
**Old Prompt**: Allowed general knowledge, weak source citation
**New Prompt**: 
- ‚úÖ ONLY uses provided context
- ‚úÖ Refuses to answer if context insufficient
- ‚úÖ Mandatory source citation
- ‚úÖ Clear document separation
- ‚úÖ Prevents hallucination

---

## üÜï New Features

### 1. Document Management API

#### **Get Statistics**
```bash
GET /api/documents/stats
```
Returns: Total vectors, dimensions, namespace info

#### **Delete Specific Document**
```bash
DELETE /api/documents/filename/{filename}
```
Example: `DELETE /api/documents/filename/old_report.pdf`
Removes all chunks from that specific document

#### **Clear All Documents**
```bash
DELETE /api/documents/clear-all
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Warning**: Deletes EVERYTHING from knowledge base

### 2. Relevance Filtering

The system now:
- Retrieves 2x requested documents
- Filters by relevance score (>0.7)
- Returns only high-confidence matches
- Logs low-relevance rejections

### 3. Better Metadata Storage

- Now stores **FULL text** in metadata (was: 500 char preview)
- Better retrieval quality
- More context for the LLM

---

## üìñ Best Practices for Using the System

### For Best Results:

1. **Clear Old Documents Before New Session**
   ```bash
   # Use this when starting with a new topic
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/documents/clear-all
   ```

2. **Upload Related Documents Together**
   - Upload all documents for a topic at once
   - This creates a coherent knowledge base

3. **Ask Specific Questions**
   - ‚ùå BAD: "Tell me about this"
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: "What are the key findings in the financial report?"
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: "According to the document, what is the project timeline?"

4. **Check Statistics**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/documents/stats
   ```
   Know how many documents are in the system

## üîç How Relevance Scoring Works

### Cosine Similarity Scale
- **0.9 - 1.0**: Extremely relevant (exact or near-exact match)
- **0.7 - 0.9**: Highly relevant (strong semantic match) ‚Üê **We use these**
- **0.5 - 0.7**: Moderately relevant (filtered out)
- **< 0.5**: Low relevance (filtered out)

### Example Query Flow:
```
1. Question: "What is the budget?"
2. Retrieve top 10 chunks
3. Filter: Keep only scores > 0.7
4. Result: 5 high-quality chunks ‚Üí LLM
5. LLM generates answer ONLY from these 5
```

---

## üéì Understanding the Improvements

### Chunk Size Impact

**Before (512 chars)**:
```
Chunk 1: "The project budget is $50,000. This includes"
Chunk 2: "marketing, development, and operational costs"
```
‚ùå Fragmented, missing context

**After (1000 chars)**:
```
Chunk 1: "The project budget is $50,000. This includes 
marketing ($15,000), development ($25,000), and 
operational costs ($10,000). The budget was approved 
on March 1st and covers Q1-Q2 activities..."
```
‚úÖ Complete context, better understanding

### Prompt Improvement

**Old System**:
```
User: "What is AI?"
LLM: "AI is artificial intelligence, a field of 
computer science..." (using general knowledge)
```
‚ùå Not using uploaded documents

**New System**:
```
User: "What is AI?"
LLM: "I cannot answer this question based on the 
provided documents. The uploaded files do not 
contain information about AI."
```
‚úÖ Honest, context-aware response

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clear Old Documents (Fresh Start)
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/documents/clear-all
```

### Step 2: Upload Your Documents
Use the UI or:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/upload \
  -F "files=@your_document.pdf"
```

### Step 3: Check Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/documents/stats
```

### Step 4: Ask Questions
Use the UI at http://localhost:8080

---

## üìä Testing the Improvements

### Test 1: Relevance Filtering
```bash
# Upload a document about "Machine Learning"
# Then ask: "What are the benefits of blockchain?"
# Expected: "I cannot answer... provided documents"
```
‚úÖ Should refuse to answer with irrelevant info

### Test 2: Source Citation
```bash
# Upload "Report_2024.pdf"
# Ask: "What are the key findings?"
# Expected: Answer with "According to Report_2024.pdf..."
```
‚úÖ Should cite specific sources

### Test 3: Context-Only Answers
```bash
# Upload a technical document
# Ask: "Explain this in simple terms"
# Expected: Simplified explanation using ONLY document content
```
‚úÖ Should not add external knowledge

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Adjust Relevance Threshold
In `.env`:
```properties
MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.7  # Default (recommended)
MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.8  # Stricter (fewer but better results)
MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.6  # Looser (more results, less precise)
```

### Adjust Chunk Size for Your Documents

**Small Documents (1-2 pages)**:
```properties
CHUNK_SIZE=800
CHUNK_OVERLAP=150
```

**Large Technical Documents**:
```properties
CHUNK_SIZE=1200
CHUNK_OVERLAP=250
```

**Books / Long Content**:
```properties
CHUNK_SIZE=1500
CHUNK_OVERLAP=300
```

## üî• Pro Tips

1. **One Topic at a Time**: Clear documents between different topics
2. **Related Documents**: Upload all related docs before querying
3. **Specific Questions**: More specific = better answers
4. **Check Relevance**: If answers seem off, check document stats
5. **Re-upload if Needed**: Sometimes re-processing helps (clear + upload again)

---

## üìù API Reference

### Query with Filtering (Future Enhancement)
```python
# Coming soon: Filter by specific document
POST /api/query
{
  "question": "What is the budget?",
  "filename_filter": "budget_2024.pdf",  # Optional
  "top_k": 5
}
```

### Stream Query
```bash
POST /api/query/stream
{
  "question": "Summarize the document",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

---

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before Improvements:
- ‚ùå Mixed information from multiple documents
- ‚ùå Vague, generic answers
- ‚ùå Sometimes used external knowledge
- ‚ùå Poor source attribution

### After Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Precise answers from specific documents
- ‚úÖ Clear source citations
- ‚úÖ Refuses to answer when information unavailable
- ‚úÖ Better context understanding
- ‚úÖ Clean document management

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Still getting mixed information"
**Solution**: Clear all documents, then upload only relevant ones
```bash
DELETE /api/documents/clear-all
```

### "Answers too short"
**Solution**: Reduce relevance threshold to 0.6 in `.env`

### "Says it doesn't know when it should"
**Solution**: 
- Check if document was properly uploaded
- Verify relevance threshold isn't too high
- Try rephrasing question to match document content

### "Want to remove one specific document"
**Solution**:
```bash
DELETE /api/documents/filename/unwanted_file.pdf
```
