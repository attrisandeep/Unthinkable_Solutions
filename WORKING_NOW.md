# ✅ SYSTEM FULLY WORKING NOW!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

### **Root Cause: Groq Model Decommissioned**

**Error Message**:
```
Error code: 400 - The model `mixtral-8x7b-32768` has been decommissioned 
and is no longer supported.
```

**What Happened**:
- The default model `mixtral-8x7b-32768` was removed by Groq
- All LLM API calls were failing with 400 errors
- The retry logic kept trying and eventually gave up
- User saw: "Internal Server Error"

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed model from `mixtral-8x7b-32768` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- Updated `.env` file
- Restarted backend
- ✅ **Queries now work!**

## 🔧 Configuration Changes

### `.env` Updated

**Old**:
```env
GROQ_MODEL=mixtral-8x7b-32768  # ❌ Decommissioned
PINECONE_ENV=us-west1-gcp      # ❌ Wrong (GCP instead of AWS)
```

**New**:
```env
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile  # ✅ Active model
PINECONE_ENV=us-east-1              # ✅ Correct AWS region
```

## 💡 Understanding the Error

### Why "Internal Server Error"?

1. **Frontend** sends query to backend
2. **Backend** retrieves relevant chunks from Pinecone ✅
3. **Backend** tries to call Groq with old model ❌
4. **Groq** returns 400: "Model decommissioned"
5. **Backend** retries 3 times (all fail)
6. **Backend** gives up, returns 500 error
7. **Frontend** shows: "Internal Server Error"

### The user saw:
> "Sorry, I encountered an error processing your question..."

### The backend saw:
> "Error code: 400 - The model `mixtral-8x7b-32768` has been decommissioned"
