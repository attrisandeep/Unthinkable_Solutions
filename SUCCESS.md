## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you upload a document:
1. ✅ File sent to backend
2. ✅ Text extracted (PDF/TXT)
3. ✅ Split into 512-character chunks
4. ✅ Embeddings created using Jina AI
5. ✅ Vectors stored in Pinecone
6. ✅ Ready for queries!

When you ask a question:
1. ✅ Question embedded using Jina AI
2. ✅ Top 5 relevant chunks retrieved from Pinecone
3. ✅ Context sent to Groq LLM (Mixtral model)
4. ✅ Answer generated and streamed back
5. ✅ Sources displayed

## 🧪 Test It Now!

### Create a Test Document

Create a file called `test.txt`:
```
KnowledgeExplorer is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
It uses FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
The system supports PDF and TXT file uploads.
It uses Pinecone for vector storage and Groq for LLM responses.
Jina AI provides cloud-based embeddings for better performance.
```

### Upload and Test

1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Click "Attach Documents"
3. Upload `test.txt`
4. Wait for "Uploaded" ✅
5. Ask: "What is KnowledgeExplorer?"
6. You should get an answer explaining it's a RAG system!
7. Ask: "What tech stack does it use?"
8. You should get details about FastAPI, React, Pinecone, etc.

## 🎯 Performance Notes

### With Jina AI (You have this!)
- ⚡ Fast cloud-based embeddings
- ⚡ High quality vectors
- ⚡ Typically 1-3 seconds per document

### Groq LLM
- ⚡ Very fast inference
- ⚡ Mixtral model (high quality)
- ⚡ Streaming responses (real-time)

### Pinecone
- ⚡ Fast vector search
- ⚡ Millisecond query times
- ⚡ Scalable storage

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails
Check backend logs for:
- "Failed to create embeddings" → Jina API issue
- "Pinecone error" → Check index exists (dimensions=768)
- "File too large" → Max 10MB per file

### If Query Returns Generic Response
- Make sure you uploaded documents first
- Check that upload showed "Uploaded" ✅
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check backend logs for errors

### If Page Won't Load
- Check both servers are running
- Try http://localhost:8080
- Check for errors in PowerShell windows
