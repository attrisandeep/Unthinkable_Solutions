RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

RAG is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation.

How RAG works:
1. A user asks a question
2. The system searches through documents to find relevant information
3. Retrieved information is sent to a language model
4. The language model generates an answer based on the retrieved information

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents
- Provides source citations for transparency
- Can work with up-to-date information without retraining
- More accurate than pure language models alone

KnowledgeExplorer is a RAG system that uses:
- FastAPI for the backend
- React for the frontend  
- Pinecone for vector storage
- Groq LLM for answer generation
- Jina AI for creating embeddings
